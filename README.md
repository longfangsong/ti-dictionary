> The right word is always a power, and communicates its definiteness to our action.

A dictionary of different concepts in TiDB/PD/TiKV.

Currently this is represented as a naive table.

⬇️ A sub-project, though the dictionary answer the "what is xxx" problems, TiManual will try to answer "how to yyy" problems.
